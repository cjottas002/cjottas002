# Hola, soy JosÃ© Luis ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate software developer with over 3 years of experience specializing in Microsoft technologies and the C# programming language. I love solving complex problems and creating software solutions that make people's lives a little easier.

My technical skills include, but are not limited to: .NET, C#, SQL Server, Razor, Angular, design patterns, clean architecture, and I am now expanding my horizons by learning Java, Kotlin, and Android app development.

I strongly believe in continuous learning and am always seeking new technologies and tools to learn. Additionally, I enjoy collaborating with others and believe that teamwork is key to creating high-quality software products.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about new technologies, exploring nature, or spending time with my loved ones.

If you want to collaborate on a project or simply say hello, feel free to send me a message.
